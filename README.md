# ToDoApp
The To-Do List project is a web app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It lets you add tasks, mark them as complete with a checkbox, and move them to a “Completed Tasks” list. You can also delete tasks you no longer need. This app helps you stay organized by tracking your progress and managing tasks effectively
